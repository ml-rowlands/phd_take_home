# phd_take_home

## Take home project for phData interview. 

1. Technical documentation is in the take_home.ipynb file and contains data exploration and experimentation.
2. Utility functions are in the helper_funcs.py file (Note to self should have named this utils.py).
3. Best model on training data is stored in the trained_model_pipeline.joblib.
4. train_model.py and test_model.py need some work to actually do what they're supposed to.
5. Don't look at how I spelled engineering in the notebook.
